The changes and discoveries of today

##listed

1. The login view was designed to desired state and the picture is in the design folder final
2. As seen in dream view file, i figured out how to put the buttons and text fields in without the
   scroller though it is actually needed here i'd implement this new development in the other pages later.
3. Edited text form global to make the width and height of the text field dynamic.
4. The container id behind th app bar in dream view. It can probably be fixed with preferredBottom from what i read.
